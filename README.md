# Crimson Code Hackathon 2022
My code from the Crimson Code Hackathon 2022 (Theme: Cougs help Cougs).

# Description:
This program takes a .csv of a student's past and upcoming assignments for the semester and allows them
to view the assignments by date, priority, class, and upcoming. The .csv file is intended to be
stored in Microsoft Onedrive or another service so the program can be kept up to date and edited from a 
computer or mobile device. Resources for mental health and homework support have also been included.

The overall intent is to allow students to effectively manage their time by showing what would be the 
most beneficial things for them to work on at any given time by analyzing priority and due dates.

# Note:
I had some other things to do so I could not dedicate the entire 24 hours to programming but I gave it 
a shot.
